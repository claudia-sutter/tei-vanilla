## TEI Vanilla

### PURPOSE
Provide an entry-level, 80-20 TEI customization with its own Guidelines and accompanying material intended as a starting point for people and projects seeking for clear best practice recommendations on the whole process. It is meant as a replacement for TEI SimplePrint and TEI Lite. 

#### Initial work plan

* effectively repack TEI simplePrint (plus or minus few modification) as Vanilla
* build a toolkit and extensive collection of auto-didactic resources (based on TEI Publisher) 
* propose Vanilla as official TEI customization (subject to TEI Council approval)
* deprecate TEI simplePrint and possibly TEI Lite (subject to TEI Council approval)
* actively advertise Vanilla as the recommended way to start with TEI
